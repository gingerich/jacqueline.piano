<h3 class="subtitle">Hi! Iâ€™m Jacquie.</h3>

A 25-year-old full time music teacher, singer/songwriter, worship leader and Christ-follower. I teach in the Kitchener-Waterloo region where my husband and I have settled down. I primarily teach all levels of piano, but also offer beginner guitar lessons.

I absolutely love my job! Getting to know students and their families is one of my favourite parts of teaching, as well as learning how to teach each student differently according to their strengths and weaknesses. I love to see my students grow as individuals as well as musicians.

My interests aside from music include a cup of tea and a good book, playing sports, an adoration for animals, artsy side projects, and all the social time I can allow for.

Thanks for listening about me and my love for teaching! I look forward to meeting and getting to know you.
