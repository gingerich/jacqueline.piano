  - title: What does your teaching curriculum look like?
    text: >
      I teach basic and advanced technique (scales, chords, arpeggios, etc.), note reading, theory, ear training & sight reading, as well as chording. 
      I teach through lesson and theory books, and students will play music from the lesson books week to week (material is usually Faber, sometimes Bastien and Helen Marlais). At an intermediate and advanced level we work through RCM pieces. I also give students the opportunity to play pieces that they know and styles they prefer along with their lesson pieces. 
      I’ve been a worship leader in my church for the past 5 years, and many of my students chord and play worship songs as well. I love incorporating those skills into students lessons if they want to play in that area (and sometimes sing as well!).
  - title: What is your background and experience in piano?
    text: >
      I’ve been teaching piano lessons for the past 5 years, originally part-time and now full time. I completed my Grade 8 RCM piano in high school, and then majored in music at University of Waterloo (completing Grade 9 & 10 piano as well as advanced music theory there). I graduated in April 2017.
  - title: What would you consider your style of teaching?
    text: >
      I would describe my style of teaching as accommodating, as well as encouraging and engaging on a friendship level with my students. I always try to ensure they are enjoying what they’re playing, while also working on material that will increase their skills.
  - title: Can you prepare students for RCM examinations?
    text: >
      Yes. The majority of my students to date have not been interested in RCM exams but I am definitely able to prepare students for these exams if they are interested in that route.
  - title: Do the students get a chance to perform their music?
    text: >
      Yes! I host a year-end piano recital and party in June, and a Christmas recital in December. This gives the students a chance to perform, meet, and hear each other play. It’s a wonderful time to enjoy the music and skills they work on throughout the year.
  - title: Do you teach students of all ages? What is your recommended age for a child to begin lessons?
    text: >
      Yes, I teach all ages from children to adults! 
      For a starting age, I recommend that children be 5 years old before starting my beginner lessons. Every child is at a different stage of learning, so it’s best you make the judgment call based on your child’s development and motivation. For example - having an understanding of some alphabet letters and the sounds that they make is fairly important to begin learning music.
  - title: Do you teach in the summer?
    text: >
      I am usually around in July and August and offer lessons if students would like to continue through the summer. Otherwise, lessons will conclude at the end of June and resume in the first or second week of September.
